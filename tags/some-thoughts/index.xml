      <description>Rehearsal of Life Einmal ist keinmal, says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.
However, the long long history of our imperial past, told us to live in a scenario once and once more won&amp;rsquo;t bring us any further either. When everyone on this land forgets about Robespierre, he will certainly return, sometimes even with cheers of joy, he again, cuts off tens of thousand heads on this land, sometimes even with joy, like a show that forever is at rehearsal with then silent audiences.</description>
